      "We must be content, not only when God gives mercies—but when
      He takes away. If we must "in everything give thanks," (1 Th. 5:18)
      then in nothing should we be discontented."

      man not enjoy what he does possess. A drop or two of vinegar will sour a whole glass of wine. Just so, let a man
      have the affluence and all worldly comforts—a drop or two of discontent will embitter and poison all. Comfort
      depends upon contentment. Jacob went halting, when the sinew upon the hollow of his thigh shrank: so, when the
      sinew of contentment begins to shrink, we go halting in our comforts. Contentment is as necessary to keep the life
      comfortable, as oil is necessary to keep the lamp burning. The clouds of discontent often drop the showers of
      tears. Would we have comfort in our lives? We may have it if we will. A Christian may carve out whatever condition
      he will to himself. Why do you complain of your troubles? it is not trouble which troubles— but discontentment. It
      is not outward affliction which can make the life of a Christian sad; a contented mind would sail above these
      waters—but when discontent gets into the heart, then it is disquieted and sinks. Use II. A check to the
      discontented Christian. Here is a just reproof to such as are discontented with their condition. This disease is
      almost epidemic. Some not content with the calling which God has set them in, must be a step higher, from the
      plough to the throne; who like the spider in the Proverbs, will "be in kings' palaces." Others desire to go from
      the shop to the pulpit; (Nu. 12:2) they would be in the temple of honor, before they are in the temple of virtue.
      They are like apes, which most show their deformity when they are climbing. It is not enough that God has
